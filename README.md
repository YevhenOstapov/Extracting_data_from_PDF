# Extracting data from a pdf report

## description
The client has a big amount of different reports daily. We developed an automatization tool that takes only necessary and not handled PDF reports from the folder twice a day, parses the data from reports, and formes new reports using only the data the client needs. All new reports save to the other folder so the client doesnâ€™t need to waste too much time checking each report daily.
